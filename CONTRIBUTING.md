## Commands to run before you commit

- `npm run test` - run test suite
- `npm run type` - run typechecker
- `npm run fmt` - run prettier (code formatter)

## Notes

The type declaration `index.d.ts` must be kept up to date manually. It can't be done automatically, [as far as I can tell](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/4433).
